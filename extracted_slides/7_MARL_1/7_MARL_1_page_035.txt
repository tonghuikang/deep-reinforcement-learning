Stationary VS Non-stationary

• Consider **multi-agent** setting.
• **Stationary environment** requires state transition be fixed throughout.
  • State transition: $p(s' \vert s, a^1, \ldots, a^n)$.
  • Given $s$ and $a^1, \ldots, a^n$, the probability distribution of the next state $s'$ is always the same.
