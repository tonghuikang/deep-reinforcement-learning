State, Action, State Transition

• There are $n$ agents.

• Let $S$ be the state.

• Let $A^i$ be the $i$-th agent's action.

• State transition:
    $p(s' \vert s, a^1, \cdots, a^n) = \mathbb{P}(S' = s' \vert S = s, A^1 = a^1, \cdots, A^n = a^n)$.

• The next state, $S'$, depends on all the agents' actions.
