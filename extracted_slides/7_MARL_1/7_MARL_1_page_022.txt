Multi-Agent Policy Learning

Nash Equilibrium

• While all the other agents' policy remain the same, the $i$-th agent cannot get better expected return by changing its own policy.
• Every agent is playing a best-response to the other agents' policies.
• Nash equilibrium indicates convergence because no one has any incentive to deviate.
