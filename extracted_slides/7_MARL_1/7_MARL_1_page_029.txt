Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

• There are $n > 1$ agents in the system.
• The agents are usually not independent.
  • Every agent's action can affect the next state.
  • Thus, every agent can affect all the other agents.
• Unless the agents are independent of each other, single-agent RL methods do not work well for MARL.
