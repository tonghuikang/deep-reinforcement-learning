Stationary VS Non-stationary

• Consider multi-agent setting.
• **Stationary environment** requires state transition be fixed throughout.
• The environment is typically stationary.
• However, from any single agent's perspective, the environment is non-stationary.
• Thus, the single-agent RL method we have learned are not applicable.
