Stationary VS Non-stationary

• Consider multi-agent setting.
• Stationary environment requires state transition be fixed throughout.
• The environment is typically stationary.
• However, from any single agent's perspective, the environment is non-stationary.
  • $p$ depends not only on $s$ and $a^i$, but also on the other agents' actions.
  • If the $i$-th agent knows only $s$ and $a^i$, then from its perspective, the state transition is not fixed.
