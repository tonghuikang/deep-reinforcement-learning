State-Value Function

• One agent's state-value, $V^i(s; \theta^1, \cdots, \theta^n)$, depends on all the agents' policies.

• If any agent changes its policy, then all of $V^1, \cdots, V^n$ can change.

• Example: soccer game.

  • A striker improves his policy, while everyone else's policies are fixed.

  • His teammates' state-values all increase.

  • The opposing players' state-values all decrease.
