Stationary VS Non-stationary

• Consider **single-agent** setting.
• **Stationary environment** requires state transition be fixed throughout.
  • State transition: $p(s' \vert s, a)$.
  • Given $s$ and $a$, the probability distribution of the next state $s'$ is always the same.
• All the single-agent RL methods we have learned so far require stationary environment.
