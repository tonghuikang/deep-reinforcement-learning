Probability Density Function (PDF)

• PDF provides a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample.

Example: Gaussian distribution

• It is a continuous distribution.
• PDF:
    $p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$.
