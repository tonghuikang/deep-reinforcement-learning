• (state, action, reward) trajectory:

    $s_1, a_1, r_1, \; s_2, a_2, r_2, \; \cdots \; , \; s_n, a_n, r_n$.

• One episode is from the the beginning to the end (Mario wins or dies).

• What is a good policy?

• A good policy leads to big cumulative reward: $\sum_{t=1}^{n} \gamma^{t-1} \cdot r_t$.

• Use the rewards to guide the learning of policy.
