Return

Definition: Return (aka cumulative future reward).

• $U_t = R_t + R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + \cdots$

Question: At time $t$, are $R_t$ and $R_{t+1}$ equally important?

• Which of the followings do you prefer?
  • I give you $80 right now.
  • I will give you $100 one year later.

• Future reward is less valuable than present reward.
• $R_{t+1}$ should be given less weight than $R_t$.
