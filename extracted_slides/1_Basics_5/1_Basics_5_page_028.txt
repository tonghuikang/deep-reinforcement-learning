Reinforcement learning of policy network

Reinforcement learning is guided by rewards.

• Suppose a game ends at step $T$.
• Rewards:
  • $r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = \cdots = r_{T-1} = 0$. (When the game has not ended.)
  • $r_T = +1$ (winner).
  • $r_T = -1$ (loser).
• Recall that return is defined by $u_t = \sum_{i=t}^T r_i$. (No discount here.)
• Winner's returns: $u_1 = u_2 = \cdots = u_T = +1$.
• Loser's returns: $u_1 = u_2 = \cdots = u_T = -1$.
