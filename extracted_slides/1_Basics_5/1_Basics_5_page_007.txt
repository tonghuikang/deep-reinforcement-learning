Training and Execution

Training in 3 steps:

1. Initialize policy network using behavior cloning.
   (Supervised learning from human experience.)

2. Train the policy network using policy gradient. (Two policy 
   networks play against each other.)

3. After training the policy network, use it to train a value 
   network.

Execution (actually play Go games):

â€¢ Do Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) using the policy and 
  value networks.
