MCTS: Summary

• MCTS has 4 steps: selection, expansion, evaluation, and backup.

• To perform one action, AlphaGo repeats the 4 steps for many times to calculate $Q(a)$ and $N(a)$ (for every action $a$.)

• AlphaGo executes the action $a$ with the highest $N(a)$ value.

• To perform the next action, AlphaGo do MCTS all over again. (Initialize $Q(a)$ and $N(a)$ to zeros.)
