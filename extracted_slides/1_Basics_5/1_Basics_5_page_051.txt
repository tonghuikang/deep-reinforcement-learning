Step 2: Expansion

[Diagram shows tree with root node $s_t$, selected red node labeled $a_t$ connecting to two green child nodes, with one path highlighted showing transition to $s_{t+1}$]

Question: What will be the opponent's action?

• Given $a_t$, the opponent's action $a_t'$ will lead to the new state $s_{t+1}$.
• The opponent's action is randomly sampled from
    $$a_t' \sim \pi(\cdot \vert s_t'; \boldsymbol{\theta}).$$
    Here, $s_t'$ is the state observed by the opponent.

• The state-transition probability $p(s_{t+1}\vert s_t, a_t)$ is unknown.
• Use the policy function $\pi$ as the state-transition function $p$.
