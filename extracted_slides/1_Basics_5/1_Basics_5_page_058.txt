Step 4: Backup

[Diagram shows tree with root $s_t$ and three red child nodes labeled $Q(a^{(1)})$, $Q(a^{(2)})$, $Q(a^{(3)})$]

• MCTS repeats such a simulation many times.
• Each child of $a_t$ has multiple recorded $V(s_{t+1})$.
• Update action-value:
    $$Q(a_t) = \text{mean}(\text{the recorded } V\text{'s}).$$
• The $Q$ values will be used in Step 1 (selection).
