Training and Execution

Training in 3 steps:

1. Train a policy network using behavior cloning.
2. Train the policy network using policy gradient algorithm.
3. Train a value network.

Execution (actually play Go games):

• Select the "best" action by Monte Carlo Tree Search.
• To perform one action, AlphaGo repeats simulations many times.
