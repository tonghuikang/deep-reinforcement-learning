Behavior Cloning

Behavior cloning is not reinforcement learning!

• Reinforcement learning: Supervision is from rewards given 
  by the environment.
• Imitation learning: Supervision is from experts' actions.

• Behavior cloning is one of the imitation learning methods.
• Behavior cloning is simply classification or regression.
