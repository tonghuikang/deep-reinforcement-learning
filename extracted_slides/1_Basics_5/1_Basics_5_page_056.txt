Step 4: Backup

[Diagram shows tree with selected action $a_t$ and two child nodes with arrows pointing to record boxes]

• MCTS repeats such a simulation many times.
• Each child of $a_t$ has multiple recorded $V(s_{t+1})$.

Records:
• $V_1^{(1)}$,
• $V_2^{(1)}$,
• $V_3^{(1)}$,
• $V_4^{(1)}$,
• ⋮

Records:
• $V_1^{(2)}$,
• $V_2^{(2)}$,
• $V_3^{(2)}$,
• $V_4^{(2)}$,
• ⋮
