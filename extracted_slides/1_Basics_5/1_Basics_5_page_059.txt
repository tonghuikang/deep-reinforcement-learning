Revisit Step 1 Selection

[Diagram shows tree with root $s_t$ and three red child nodes labeled $Q(a^{(1)})$, $Q(a^{(2)})$, $Q(a^{(3)})$]

First, for all the valid actions $a$, calculate the score:
$$\text{score}(a) = Q(a) + \eta \cdot \frac{\pi(a \vert s_t; \boldsymbol{\theta})}{1+N(a)}.$$

Second, the action with the biggest score(a) is selected.
