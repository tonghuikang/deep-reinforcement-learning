How do human play Go?

Players must look ahead two or more steps.

• Suppose I choose action $a_t$.
• What will be my opponent's action? (His action leads to state $s_{t+1}$.)
• What will I be my action $a_{t+1}$ upon observing $s_{t+1}$?
• What will be my opponent's action? (His action leads to state $s_{t+2}$.)
• What will I be my action $a_{t+2}$ upon observing $s_{t+3}$?

• If you can exhaustively foresee all the possibilities, you will win.
