Why is overestimation harmful?

Unfortunately, the overestimation is non-uniform.

• Use a transition, $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$, to update $\mathbf{w}$.

• The TD target, $y_t$, overestimates $Q^*(s_t, a_t)$.

• TD algorithm pushes $Q(s_t, a_t; \mathbf{w})$ towards $y_t$.

• Thus, $Q(s_t, a_t; \mathbf{w})$ overestimates $Q^*(s_t, a_t)$.
