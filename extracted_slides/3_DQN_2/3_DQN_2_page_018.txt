Why is overestimation harmful?

The agent is controlled by the DQN: $a_t = \text{argmax}_a Q(s_t, a; \mathbf{w})$.

Uniform overestimation is not a problem.

Non-uniform overestimation is problematic.

• $Q^*(s, a^1) = 200$, $Q^*(s, a^2) = 100$, and $Q^*(s, a^3) = 230$.

• $Q(s, a^1; \mathbf{w}) = 280$, $Q(s, a^2; \mathbf{w}) = 300$, and $Q(s, a^3; \mathbf{w}) = 240$.

• Then $a^2$ (which is bad) will be selected.
