Overestimation & Solutions

• Because of the maximization, the TD target overestimates the true action-value.

• By creating a "positive feedback loop", bootstrapping further exacerbates the overestimation.

• Target network can partly avoid bootstrapping. (Not completely, because $\mathbf{w}^-$ depends on $\mathbf{w}$.)

• Double DQN alleviates the overestimation caused by the maximization.
