Architectures

• Fully decentralized: Every agent uses its own observations and rewards to learn its policy. Agents do not communicate.

• Fully centralized: The agents send everything to the central controller. The controller makes decisions for all the agents.

• Centralized training with decentralized execution: A central controller is used during training. The controller is disabled after training.
