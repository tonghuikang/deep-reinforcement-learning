Shortcoming: Slow during Execution

• All the agents send their observations to the central controller.

• The central controller makes decisions, $\mathbf{a} = [a^1, a^2, \ldots, a^n]$, and sends $a^i$ to the $i$-th agent.

• Communication and synchronization cost time.

• Real-time decision is impossible.
