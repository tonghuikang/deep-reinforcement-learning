Importance Sampling

• Use importance sampling instead of uniform sampling.

• Option 1: Sampling probability $p_t \propto |\delta_t| + \epsilon$.

• Option 2: Sampling probability $p_t \propto \frac{1}{\text{rank}(t)}$.
  • The transitions are sorted so that $|\delta_t|$ is in the descending order.
  • $\text{rank}(t)$ is the rank of the $t$-th transition.

• In sum, big $|\delta_t|$ shall be given high priority.
