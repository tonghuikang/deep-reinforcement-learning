Update TD Error

• Associate each transition, $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$, with a TD error, $\delta_t$.

• If a transition is newly collected, we do not know its $\delta_t$.
  • Simply set its $\delta_t$ to the maximum.
  • It has the highest priority.

• Each time $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$ is selected from the buffer, we update its $\delta_t$.
