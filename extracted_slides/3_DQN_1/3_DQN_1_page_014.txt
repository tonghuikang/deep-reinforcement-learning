Experience Replay

• A transition: $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$.

• Store recent $n$ transitions in a replay buffer.

• Remove old transitions so that the buffer has at most $n$ transitions.

• Buffer capacity $n$ is a tuning hyper-parameter [1, 2].
  • $n$ is typically large, e.g., $10^5 \sim 10^6$.
  • The setting of $n$ is application-specific.
