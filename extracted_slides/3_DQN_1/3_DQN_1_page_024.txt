Scaling Learning Rate

• Scale the learning rate by $(n p_t)^{-\beta}$, where $\beta \in (0,1)$.

• If $p_1 = \cdots = p_n = \frac{1}{n}$ (uniform sampling), the scaling factor is equal to 1.

• High-importance transitions (with high $p_t$) have low learning rates.

• In the beginning, set $\beta$ small; increase $\beta$ to 1 over time.
