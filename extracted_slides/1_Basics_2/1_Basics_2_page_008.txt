Approximate the Q Function

Goal: Win the game ($\approx$ maximize the total reward.)

Question: If we know $Q^*(s, a)$, what is the best action?

â€¢ Obviously, the best action is $a^* = \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$.

$Q^*$ is an indicator of how good it is for an agent to pick action $a$ while being in state $s$.
