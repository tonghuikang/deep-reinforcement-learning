Deep Q Network (DQN)

• Input shape: size of the screenshot.
• Output shape: dimension of action space.

[The image shows the same neural network diagram as before, but now with example Q-values:
- Input: A game screenshot (state $s$) 
- Processing: Conv layer followed by Dense layer (labeled as "feature")
- Output: Three Q-values:
  - $Q(s, \text{"left"}; \mathbf{w}) = 2000$
  - $Q(s, \text{"right"}; \mathbf{w}) = 1000$
  - $Q(s, \text{"up"}; \mathbf{w}) = 3000$]

Question: Based on the predictions, what should be the action?
