Action-Value Functions $Q(s, a)$

Definition: Discounted return (aka cumulative discounted future reward).

• $U_t = R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \gamma^3 R_{t+3} + \cdots$

Definition: Action-value function for policy $\pi$.

• $Q_\pi(s_t, a_t) = \mathbb{E} [U_t \vert S_t = s_t, A_t = a_t]$.

• Taken w.r.t. actions $A_{t+1}, A_{t+2}, A_{t+3}, \cdots$ and states $S_{t+1}, S_{t+2}, S_{t+3}, \cdots$
• Integrate out everything except for the observations: $A_t = a_t$ and $S_t = s_t$.
