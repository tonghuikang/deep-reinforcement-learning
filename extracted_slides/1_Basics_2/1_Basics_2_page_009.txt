Approximate the Q Function

Goal: Win the game ($\approx$ maximize the total reward.)

Question: If we know $Q^*(s, a)$, what is the best action?

• Obviously, the best action is $a^* = \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$.

Challenge: We do not know $Q^*(s, a)$.

• Solution: Deep Q Network (DQN)
• Use neural network $Q(s, a; \mathbf{w})$ to approximate $Q^*(s, a)$.
