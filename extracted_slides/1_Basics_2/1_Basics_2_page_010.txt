Deep Q Network (DQN)

• Input shape: size of the screenshot.
• Output shape: dimension of action space.

[The image shows a neural network diagram with:
- Input: A game screenshot (state $s$) showing what appears to be a Mario-style game
- Processing: Conv layer followed by Dense layer (labeled as "feature")
- Output: Three Q-values:
  - $Q(s, \text{"left"}; \mathbf{w})$
  - $Q(s, \text{"right"}; \mathbf{w})$
  - $Q(s, \text{"up"}; \mathbf{w})$]
