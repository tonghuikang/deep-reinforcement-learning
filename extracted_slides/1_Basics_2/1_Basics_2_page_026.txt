Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

• Model's estimate:
    NYC to Atlanta: 1000 minutes (estimate).
• I arrived at DC; actual time cost:
    NYC to DC: 300 minutes (actual).
• Model now updates its estimate:
    DC to Atlanta: 600 minutes (estimate).

[The image shows a diagram with NYC at the top, DC in the middle, and Atlanta at the bottom. NYC to DC shows "300 minutes (actual)." and DC to Atlanta shows "600 minutes (estimate)."]
