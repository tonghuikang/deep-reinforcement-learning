Parameter Sharing

[THIS IS FIGURE: A neural network architecture diagram showing:
- Input: Mario game scene as "state s"
- Conv layer processing the state into "feature"
- Two branches from the feature: Dense1 leading to Softmax for π(a|s; θ) and Dense2 leading to v(s; w)
The diagram illustrates parameter sharing between policy and value networks through the shared Conv and feature extraction layers.]
