Approximate state-value, $V_\pi(s)$, by value network, $v(s; \boldsymbol{w})$.

[THIS IS FIGURE: A diagram showing a Mario game scene as input "state s", connected through "Conv" (convolutional layer) and "Dense" layer to output a scalar value "v(s; w)". The layers are connected with arrows showing "feature" extraction.]
