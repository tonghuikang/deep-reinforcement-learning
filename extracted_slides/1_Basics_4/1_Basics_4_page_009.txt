Value Network (Critic): $q(s, a; \mathbf{w})$

• Inputs: state $s$.
• Output: action-values of all the actions.

[Image shows a Super Mario game screenshot labeled "state s" going through Conv → Dense layers to produce a "feature" vector, which then outputs:
$q(s, "left"; \mathbf{w}) = 2000$
$q(s, "right"; \mathbf{w}) = 1000$
$q(s, "up"; \mathbf{w}) = 3000$]
