Stochastic                    Deterministic
Policy                        Policy

Policy:        $\pi(a \vert s; \boldsymbol{\theta})$        $\pi(s; \boldsymbol{\theta})$

Output:        Probability distribution        Action $a$
               over the action space

Control:       Randomly sample an action       Directly use
               from the distribution           the output, $a$

Application:   Mostly discrete                 Continuous
