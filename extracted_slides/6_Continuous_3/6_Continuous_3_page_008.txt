Function Approximation

• Approximate the mean, $\boldsymbol{\mu}(s)$, by the neural network, $\boldsymbol{\mu}(s; \boldsymbol{\theta}^{\mu})$.

• ~~Approximate the std, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(s)$, by the neural network, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(s; \boldsymbol{\theta}^{\sigma})$~~.

• A better practice is to approximate the log variance:

    $\rho_i = \ln \sigma_i^2$, for $i = 1, \cdots, d$.

• Approximate $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ by the neural network, $\boldsymbol{\rho}(s; \boldsymbol{\theta}^{\rho})$.
